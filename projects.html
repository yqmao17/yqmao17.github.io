## FPGA â€“ Flappy Bird Interactive Game

- Created a Nios II based system on the Altera Cyclone IV device and wrote a protocol to interface a keyboard and a monitor with the DE2 board using the on-board USB and VGA ports
- Used EDA tools to synthesize game logic described in SystemVerilog to be implemented and mapped to an FPGA
- Constructed an algorithm to randomly generate the location of the game sprites
